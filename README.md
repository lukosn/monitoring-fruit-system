Implementation of a system for monitoring the conditions of fruit transport and storage using STM32F303VCT6, accecelometer ADXL345, temperature, humidity and pressure sensor BME280, microSD memory card and LCD display. The operation of the system is intended to consist of cyclic measurements of temperature, pressure, and humidity, as well as shock detection, with the recording of these data on a memory card.
